# DSA and LeetCode Solutions in Python

## Overview
DSA and LeetCode Solutions in Python is a personal repository that includes my implementations of various data structures and algorithms (DSA) in Python, along with solutions to LeetCode problems. It aims to provide a clear understanding of DSA concepts and practical implementations to help users prepare for technical interviews and improve their problem-solving skills.

**Note:** This repository is inspired by the teachings of `Scott Barrett`. You can explore more of his work and insights [here](https://www.scottbarrett.com).

## Features
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of common data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.
- **Algorithms**: Detailed implementations of algorithms including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and others.
- **LeetCode Solutions**: Solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems with explanations and code.
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation and comments within the code to aid understanding.
- **Setup Instructions**: Easy setup and usage instructions to get started quickly.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/emads22/dsa-and-leetcode-python.git
    ```
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. Install the required dependencies using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the specific data structure or algorithm file you want to run, for example:
    ```bash
    cd data_structures
    python linked_list.py
    ```
2. Follow the instructions or examples provided within each file to test and understand the implementations.
3. For LeetCode solutions, navigate to the `leetcode` directory and run the desired solution file.
