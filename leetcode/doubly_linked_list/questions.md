## 1. Swap First and Last (**Interview Question**)

### Implement the `swap_first_last` method for the `DoublyLinkedList` class. This method should swap the values of the first and last node.

**Note**: that the pointers to the nodes themselves are not swapped - only their values are exchanged.

## 2. Reverse (**Interview Question**)

### Create a new method called `reverse` that reverses the order of the nodes in the list, i.e., the first node becomes the last node, the second node becomes the second-to-last node, and so on.

To do this, you'll need to traverse the list and change the direction of the pointers between the nodes so that they point in the opposite direction.

Do not change the value of any of the nodes.

Once you've done this for all nodes, you'll also need to update the head and tail pointers to reflect the new order of the nodes.
