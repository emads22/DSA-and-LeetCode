## 1. Implement Stack Using a List (**Interview Question**)

- ### Create a constructor for Class Stack that implements a new stack with an empty list called `stack_list`.

- ### Add a method to push a value onto the Stack implementation.

- ### Add a method to pop a value from the Stack implementation.

## 2. Parentheses Balanced (**Interview Question**)

### Implement a function called `is_balanced_parentheses` that checks if a string of parentheses is balanced or not.

By "balanced," we mean that for every open parenthesis, there is a matching closing parenthesis in the correct order. For example, the string `"((()))"` has three pairs of balanced parentheses, so it is a balanced string. On the other hand, the string `"(()))"` has an imbalance, as the last two parentheses do not match, so it is not balanced. Also, the string `")("` is not balanced because the close parenthesis needs to follow the open parenthesis.

Your program should take a string of parentheses as input and return `True` if it is balanced, or `False` if it is not. In order to solve this problem, use a `Stack` data structure implemented as a list.

**Note:** This is not a method within the `Stack` class, but a separate function.

## 3. Reverse String (**Interview Question**)

### The `reverse_string` function takes a single parameter `string`, which is the string you want to reverse, and return a new string with the letters in reverse order.

This will use the `Stack` data structure implemented as a list.
